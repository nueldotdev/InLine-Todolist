# InLine Task Manager

Welcome to InLine, the task manager that's so basic, even a potato could use it! Built with Python and the `curses` library, because I had nothing better to do. I saw a random photo and thought, "I wanna make this pointless thing now!" So here I am.

## Features
- Add, delete, and manage tasks like it's 1999
- Mark tasks as completed or starred, because why not
- Add tags to tasks, because I heard it's a thing
- View task completion statistics, because I needed to fill space

## Setup

### Requirements
To run InLine, you need Python installed on your system. If you don't have it, well, good luck. Install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Application
To start the InLine Task Manager, simply run the `main.py` script. It's that simple:

```sh
python main.py
```

### Usage
- Use the arrow keys to navigate through tasks. It's like playing a game, but way less fun.
- Press `a` to add a new task. Because you have nothing better to do.
- Press `d` to delete the selected task. Cause you have nothing better to do.
- Press `t` to add or edit tags for the selected task. Wait... why are you even reading this right now?
- Press `*` to star or unstar the selected task. You seriously still here?
- Press the spacebar to mark the selected task as completed or incomplete. Whatever.
- Press `h` to view the help menu. Because you'll probably need it (if you're still here, you DO NEED HELP).
- Press `q` to quit the application. Please go back to living a life.

Just play around with it since you have nothing better to do.
